# higher-education

Education is important for success. In Portugal, there is a problem with students failing or
dropping out. When this is the case, many students do not even consider going on to higher
education. This project aims to predict a studentâ€™s intent to go on to higher education as a
function of several variables relating to their school performance and circumstances. If done
successfully, we can use this information to better target students who need support and
encouragement to continue their education. 

The purpose of this project was to apply my statistics skills to a real life data set.

The data I used was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

The code was written in Rstudio.
